# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? 

I feel good because I found good outside resources and I was able to fuse both class examples and outside resources in order to help me with these problems. 


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? 

My workflow consists of taking me time first then going into doing my work. I noticed that his method actually works for me and I'm able to stay focused without getting sidetracked. 


- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

 I learned how to locate outside resources to both save time and learn new things and I also learned the layout and syntax of a Class.
